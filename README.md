Gor is a "batteries included" web framework for Go, inspired by Ruby on Rails's productivity-focused approach while leveraging Go's performance, type safety, and concurrency advantages.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install Gor CLI
go install github.com/cuemby/gor/cmd/gor@latest

# Create and run your first app
gor new myapp && cd myapp
gor server
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

- [API Reference](./docs/api.md) - Complete API documentation
- [Examples](./examples/) - Sample applications demonstrating features

## Overview

Gor aims to provide solo developers and small teams with the same rapid development experience as Rails, but with Go's superior performance and deployment characteristics.

### Core Philosophy

- **Convention Over Configuration**: Sensible defaults for 80% of use cases
- **Batteries Included**: Essential components integrated out of the box
- **Type Safety**: Leverage Go's compile-time checking for reliability
- **Performance**: 10x+ faster than Rails while maintaining productivity
- **Simplicity**: Single binary deployment with embedded assets

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

#### 1. Framework Core (`pkg/gor/framework.go`)

- **Application**: Central application instance coordinating all components
- **Router**: Rails-style RESTful routing with middleware support
- **Controller**: MVC pattern with standard CRUD actions
- **Context**: Enhanced request/response context with Gor-specific features
- **Config**: Environment-based configuration management

#### 2. ORM Layer (`pkg/gor/orm.go`)

- **Type-safe ORM**: Inspired by ActiveRecord but leveraging Go's type system
- **Query Builder**: Fluent interface for building database queries
- **Migrations**: Database schema versioning and management
- **Associations**: Support for relationships between models
- **Validation**: Model validation with custom rules
- **Scopes**: Reusable query logic

#### 3. Solid Trifecta (Rails Inspired)

##### Queue System (`pkg/gor/queue.go`)

- **Database-backed**: SQLite/PostgreSQL backed job processing
- **Worker Management**: Concurrent job processing with goroutines
- **Job Types**: Support for various job patterns (email, webhooks, cleanup)
- **Monitoring**: Real-time job statistics and monitoring
- **Recurring Jobs**: Cron-like scheduled job support

##### Cache System (`pkg/gor/cache.go`)

- **Multi-tier**: Memory → Disk → Database caching strategy
- **Tagged Caching**: Group invalidation with cache tags
- **Fragment Caching**: Partial template caching support
- **Performance**: High-performance caching with compression and encryption
- **Monitoring**: Cache hit/miss statistics and performance metrics

##### Cable System (`pkg/gor/cable.go`)

- **Real-time Messaging**: WebSocket and SSE support
- **Channel System**: Organized real-time communication
- **Presence**: User presence tracking
- **Broadcasting**: Efficient message broadcasting
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Cluster support for multiple nodes

#### 4. Authentication System (`pkg/gor/auth.go`)

- **Built-in Auth**: Complete authentication system out of the box
- **JWT & Sessions**: Support for both token and session-based auth
- **Role-based Access**: Flexible role and permission system
- **MFA Support**: Multi-factor authentication with TOTP/SMS
- **OAuth Integration**: Support for external OAuth providers
- **Security**: Password policies, rate limiting, audit logging
