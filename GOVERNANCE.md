- **Code of conduct enforcement**: Handled by designated moderators
- **Release planning**: Led by release manager with maintainer input
- **Security responses**: Expedited process led by security team

### RFC Process

For significant changes, we follow a Request for Comments (RFC) process:

1. **Draft RFC**: Create detailed proposal document
2. **Community Review**: 2-week public comment period
